  "long_description": "molly-guard attempts to prevent you from accidentally shutting down or rebooting machines. It does this by injecting a couple of checks before the existing commands: halt, reboot, shutdown, and poweroff. This happens via scripts with the same names in /usr/sbin, so it only works if you have /usr/sbin before /sbin in your PATH!",

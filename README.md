Description
===========
This is the chef setup I use for my lab. A lot of the details will be obfuscated while I make it public, so no one has all my juicy details. This is where I learned how to use chef, and various other tools. Some of it I'm proud of, some of it is questionable, and some of it is flat out wrong (I blame the scotch). 

I wanted to clean this up first, but that's a never-ending process, so I've decided I need to just start. I'm probably not going to keep updating this repo as my lab updates, but if anyone find bugs and submit's a pull request, I'll take a look.

I used this as a learning environment, so I've borrowed a lot of public code. If you see your code on here, LMK, and show me where your code is, and I'll attribute you. I didn't intent to use public code without recognizing anyone, I just screwed up my repo a couple of times (lab, remember?) and lost a lot of the md data.

This was all set up on debian. There is support for other flavors built into a lot of these cookbooks, but I have no idea how well they work. Use at your own risk.

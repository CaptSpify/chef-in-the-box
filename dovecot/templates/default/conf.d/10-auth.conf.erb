## Authentication processes
##

# Disable LOGIN command and all other plaintext authentications unless
# SSL/TLS is used (LOGINDISABLED capability). Note that if the remote IP
# matches the local IP (ie. you're connecting from the same computer), the
# connection is considered secure and plaintext authentication is allowed.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'disable_plaintext_auth', true) %>

# Authentication cache size (e.g. 10M). 0 means it's disabled. Note that
# bsdauth, PAM and vpopmail require cache_key to be set for caching to be used.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_cache_size', 0) %>
# Time to live for cached data. After TTL expires the cached record is no
# longer used, *except* if the main database lookup returns internal failure.
# We also try to handle password changes automatically: If user's previous
# authentication was successful, but this one wasn't, the cache isn't used.
# For now this works only with plaintext authentication.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_cache_ttl', '1 hour') %>
# TTL for negative hits (user not found, password mismatch).
# 0 disables caching them completely.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_cache_negative_ttl', '1 hour') %>

# Space separated list of realms for SASL authentication mechanisms that need
# them. You can leave it empty if you don't want to support multiple realms.
# Many clients simply use the first one listed here, so keep the default realm
# first.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_realms') %>

# Default realm/domain to use if none was specified. This is used for both
# SASL realms and appending @domain to username in plaintext logins.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_default_realm') %>

# List of allowed characters in username. If the user-given username contains
# a character not listed in here, the login automatically fails. This is just
# an extra check to make sure user can't exploit any potential quote escaping
# vulnerabilities with SQL/LDAP databases. If you want to allow all characters,
# set this value to empty.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_username_chars', 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ01234567890.-_@') %>

# Username character translations before it's looked up from databases. The
# value contains series of from -> to characters. For example "#@/@" means
# that '#' and '/' characters are translated to '@'.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_username_translation') %>

# Username formatting before it's looked up from databases. You can use
# the standard variables here, eg. %Lu would lowercase the username, %n would
# drop away the domain if it was given, or "%n-AT-%d" would change the '@' into
# "-AT-". This translation is done after auth_username_translation changes.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_username_format') %>

# If you want to allow master users to log in by specifying the master
# username within the normal username string (ie. not using SASL mechanism's
# support for it), you can specify the separator character here. The format
# is then <username><separator><master username>. UW-IMAP uses "*" as the
# separator, so that could be a good choice.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_master_user_separator') %>

# Username to use for users logging in with ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_anonymous_username', 'anonymous') %>

# Maximum number of dovecot-auth worker processes. They're used to execute
# blocking passdb and userdb queries (eg. MySQL and PAM). They're
# automatically created and destroyed as needed.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_worker_max_count', 30) %>

# Host name to use in GSSAPI principal names. The default is to use the
# name returned by gethostname(). Use "$ALL" (with quotes) to allow all keytab
# entries.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_gssapi_hostname') %>

# Kerberos keytab to use for the GSSAPI mechanism. Will use the system
# default (usually /etc/krb5.keytab) if not specified. You may need to change
# the auth service to run as root to be able to read this file.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_krb5_keytab') %>

# Do NTLM and GSS-SPNEGO authentication using Samba's winbind daemon and
# ntlm_auth helper. <doc/wiki/Authentication/Mechanisms/Winbind.txt>
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_use_winbind', false) %>

# Path for Samba's ntlm_auth helper binary.

# Time to delay before replying to failed authentications.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_failure_delay', '2 secs') %>

# Require a valid SSL client certificate or the authentication fails.
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_ssl_require_client_cert', false) %>

# Take the username from client's SSL certificate, using 
# X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID() which returns the subject's DN's
# CommonName. 
<%= Dovecot::Conf.attribute(@conf, 'auth_ssl_username_from_cert', false) %>

# Space separated list of wanted authentication mechanisms:

## Password and user databases
##

#
# Password database is used to verify user's password (and nothing more).
# You can have multiple passdbs and userdbs. This is useful if you want to
# allow both system users (/etc/passwd) and virtual users to login without
# duplicating the system users into virtual database.
#
# <doc/wiki/PasswordDatabase.txt>
#
# User database specifies where mails are located and what user/group IDs
# own them. For single-UID configuration use "static" userdb.
#
